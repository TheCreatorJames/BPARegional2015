The BPA Regional C++ Prompt Solution in 2015.


### What is this?
There is a competition called Business Professionals of America. They give us a prompt and a limited amount of time to solve it. We compete to solve as much of the problem as we can in a limited amount of time. We are also usually given test data to run our algorithm against. 

We are given an hour at regional level to develop the piece of code given on the prompt. Before writing the code, part of our time must be allocated to thorougly reading the prompt and rubric and understanding the task at hand. The rubric scores each component of the prompt separately, giving students the chance to prioritize certain tasks over others. In the event of a tie, the student who finishes earlier wins, so most students who win the competition do not take up the entire time unless completely necessary.

Although the code appears to be a short and simple solution, much of your time in the room is spent analyzing the prompt for details that could be overlooked and acquire penalties against your score.

This prompt was dedicated to computing digits of Pi using the Leibniz formula. We quickly had to read the formula to understand it and implement it efficiently. The prompt required us to go out to a total of ten digits, and be able to specify the accuracy of the calculatons through adjusting the number of iterations to compute Pi.

### Disclaimer
I used .NET at this level, making this Visual C++. I'm not proud of myself for that, so after this I swore to only write in pure C++.

### How did it rank?
First in its region.
